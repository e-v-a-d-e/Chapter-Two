# Chapter-Two
Oja has barely made it out of Yenagoa in the Delta region where gas flaring has been rampant when suddenly he falls ambush to Idiagbon counter action for the expulsion and deportation of his brother in-law from the Nigerian High Commission, London for his role in the Umaru affair.  Captured and jailed, he teams up with an engineer by the name Robin Grey alongside other expatriates in organizing the biggest Kirikiri Prison jail break. Although the escape was successful for the expatriates, the mastermind, Mr Grey did not make it out alive but not without giving their captors a grandstand mayhem of a diplomatic “baggage” or should we say “barrage”.  1-17 (BK_B)(i) 18-24 (BK_B)(ii) 25-27 [?(BK_B)](?) 28-29 [*(BK_B)](*) 30-32 [?(BK_B)](?) 32-46 (BK_B)(iii) 47-55 (BK_B)(ii) 56 (BK_B)(iii) 57 (BK_B)(ii) 58-59 (BK_B)(iii) 60 (BK_B)(ii) 61-81 (BK_B)(iii) 81-86 (BK_B)(ii) 87-110 (BK_B)(iii)
